# Welcome to COESSING Python labs!

All COESSING 2021 Python labs have been consolidated here in a JupyterBook! This book contains Jupyter notebooks and can be run using our very own COESSING JupyterHub, generously set up by the non-profit organization [2i2c](http://2i2c.org).

:::{note}
Use JupyterHub to run the notebooks!

Check out the table of contents on the left-hand sidebar to view all of the notebooks available.
